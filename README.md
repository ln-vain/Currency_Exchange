# Currency Exchange Console Application

This is a simple console application written in C# that simulates a basic currency exchange operation between rubles and US dollars. The project is intended for educational purposes and demonstrates the use of basic programming constructs such as variables, input/output, conditional statements, and control flow.

## Features

- Input of initial balances in rubles and dollars.
- Selection of currency to exchange.
- Execution of exchange operation based on a fixed exchange rate.
- Validation of available funds before performing the transaction.
- Display of updated balances after the transaction.

## Exchange Rate

- 1 USD = 78 RUB (fixed rate)

## How to Run the Program

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or another C# IDE.
3. Ensure that a Console App (.NET Core) project is used.
4. Replace the contents of Program.cs with the provided code if necessary.
5. Build and run the application.

## Learning Objectives

This project helps to develop understanding of:

- Console input and output in C# (Console.ReadLine, Console.WriteLine)
- Declaration and use of variables (float, int, string)
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Conditional statements (if, else)
- switch statements and control structures
- Basic program logic and structure

## Disclaimer

This application uses a hardcoded exchange rate and does not interact with any real currency exchange systems. It is designed solely for demonstration and practice.
